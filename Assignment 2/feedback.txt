[-] The very first expression you write up for p(x_n|x_N) does not hold.
    Summing a conditional probability over the conditional variable will give you numbers that can no longer be interpreted as probabilities since they do not necessarily add up to one.
    Instead: by def of cond prob we have p(x_n|x_N) = p(x_n,x_N)/p(x_N). Now, we just need to show that the numerator and the denominator can, separately, be solved using the message chaining algorithm.  
[+] Shows that p(x_N) can be solved efficiently.
    Careful with typos, when showing p(x_N) you often switch to n where it should be N.
[+] Some of the discussion of the message passing makes good sense, other parts are dependent on the mistaken equation in the beginning.

[+] Good solution, table is correct
[+] Good that you explicitly mention the values of x^{hat} and y^{hat}

[+] You show correct expression for the bagged estimate
[+] You correctly prove that the bagged estimate converges to original estimate
[-] Some more explicit explanation needed for why the mean of the gaussian noise approaches zero as B approaches infinity (Law of Large Numbers)

[+] You show results for the decision tree
[-] The task was to compare the results of spam classification using the decision tree, a bagging method with decision tree as base learner and a boosting method with decision tree as base learners, where you had to implement the bagging and boosting methods yourself. 
    Also, in general, there would need to be some description of the implementations in the report as well as discussion of hyperparameters.
